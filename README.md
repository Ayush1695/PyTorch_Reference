# PyTorch_Reference

This a repo where I have accumulated & prepared some referance material for Pytorch. 

What will you learn or refer:
1) Basic tensor operations in Pytorch
2) Building a vanilla LR model using SGD, mini batch GD.
3) Building vanilla Logistic model
4) Introduction to Neural Networks with some theory
5) Deep Neural Network Introduction
6) Momentum Concepts
7) Batch Normalization
8) Convolution, MaxPooling, Flattening Concepts
9) Shallow to Deep CNN model

At the end you will find a capstone notebook where I implemented my learnings on an open source kaggle dataset.

Please upvote my work if you liked my approach, this will really help me boost my morale to implement novel algorithms & will motivate me to write some more useful content for the data science community.
